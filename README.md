# Java-Playable-Chess
Playable Chess game developed in Java

Hello!

This is still under development, so there may be a few bugs. In the current version you can move the pieces
around accordingly, and eat other pieces.

Make sure to unzip both textures folder and have it located with your src file when running.

THINGS THAT NEED TO COMPLETED:
- Function that checks for a checkmate
- Function that displays coordinate moves on the GUI
- Update certain textures with cleaner options
