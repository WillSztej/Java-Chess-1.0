# Java-Chess-1.0
Playable Chess game developed in Java

The following is an initial implementation of a playable Chess game. This was developed a few years ago, when I had
just started to learn the basics of object-oriented programming. The UI was structured from the javax.swing package, 
with some additional textures done by myself in Adobe PhotoShop. All logic pertaining the game is built with Java,
and can be run locally from MainControl.java.

As for right now, the texture folders must be unzipped and refactored to the src file in order to run. An update is soon
to be made to remove this step.

The game has limited functionality, as this was made when I was experimenting as a beginner. As per real life chess, white
and black pieces are moved during different turns, pieces can be eaten, and a player can win by checkmating the opposing
player's king. There is no server side functionality, so if you were to play this with another person you would have to
share the same computer and application in-person. 

I am planning to expand upon this project with an entirely new implemention. This new version will have the chess game 
hosted on a webservice, to which you can invite friends to join your game and compete online. You can view the on-going 
progession of this new project here on GitHub:
